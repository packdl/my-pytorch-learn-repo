## Notes from TA session.
# 1-1 - 
## rank of input x from 0 to 2pi. 
Do not need to set the # of parameters equal, just close.

First figure is training loss
2nd figure is prediction of each model

Import MNIST or CIFAR-10 from Torch vision. Use either CNN or DNN. Show loss and accuracy. Comment on results & show observservations

# 1-2
- Collect parameters of the models - Grab from every layer - Collect and put into 1 dimensional feaure than reduce to a feature with only 2 numbers
- Look up PCA
- FIgiure out how to compute second order optimization method ex: Newton's method or Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
